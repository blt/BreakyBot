BreakyBot - A broken break dancing robot.
===============

This project is silly and serves only to demonstrate an issue with Akka
exception reporting in the supervision heirarchy boot sequence. However,
patches _are_ welcome to make this poor robot actually break dance.

Getting Started
---------------

Kindly do these things:

```
> sbt reload update compile test akka-deploy
